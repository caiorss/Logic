Logic

Just playing around with Logic and boolean minimization for now...

This code is in OCaml.  To compile:

ocamlc -o logic logic.ml

OR (to add oUnit): 

ocamlfind ocamlc -o logic -linkpkg -package oUnit logic.ml

Now that I've added tests it's better to build with omake (you'll need to install omake if you don't have it installed).  An OMakefile has been added to the project.
